# Sorting-Tool
JetBrains Academy project 

### 1/6 Numbers only

Start by teaching your program to process numeric data. Feed it some numbers and ask it to determine the largest value and its frequency in the data set. 

### 2/6 Not just numbers

Data can also be words or phrases, and your program should be able to handle them just as well. Enable your program to process different types of data and determine the greatest/longest input elements, as well as their frequency in the data set. 

### 3/6 Sorting it out

Start implementing the core part of your program: sorting. 

### 4/6 Everything counts

Implement sorting for all types of data and learn how to use Collections to calculate, store, and display the elementsâ€™ frequency. 

### 5/6 Error!

Oh no! Someone is misusing the arguments! Make the program notify users about such errors if they occur. 

### 6/6 X-files

Make it possible for your program to use files for input and output.
